# Personal Website
This is my portfolio website, built with the static site generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and designed with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

[Take a look!](https://akash.dev/)

## Getting Started
Run the 11ty dev server and compile the CSS for development:
```
npm run dev
```

## Building for production
Compile the HTML templates and invoke the full PostCSS toolchain:
```
npm run build
```

## Deployment
This project is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages, so use the included deploy script `deploy.sh` to build the project and push the output to the GitHub Pages repo:
```
npm run deploy
```
You can view the current build [here](https://github.com/FestiveAkp/festiveakp.github.io).
